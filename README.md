#AltcoinArbitrage

What is is?
-------------
This project is an abandoned project meant to automate arbitrage trading between cryptocurrencies on different cyptocurrency exchanges

The main work done was in creating functional libraries that hooked into web-apis for different exchanges. Attempting to homogenize all the data took up a great portion of my time and I never got to improve the methods for calculating and maximizing earnings.
